<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm @silent-this-sonder, and welcome to my profile 😄</p>

<p>I am a:</p>
<ul>
<li>girl</li>
<li>coder</li>
<li>artist</li>
<li>writer</li>
<li>🎮amateur text adventurer</li>
<li>😆owner of outdated books</li>
</ul>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I "know" a variety of languages, but my oldest is Python, which I am most comfortable with.</p>

<p>I love OOP, recursion, and anything cool.</p>

<p>My other languages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scratch, my other favorite place to hang out</li>
<li>Inform 7, yes it's a rather unconventional language but it's got so many nuances and I like it (so don't question it😠)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS (please no😭)</li>
<li>JavaScript (still learning, it's pretty cool)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
<p>I have a lot of project ideas.  Right now, I'm working on an Inform 7 text adventure and a Scratch project.  However, I also have plans for a pygame thing.</p>
