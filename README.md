# About Me
Hi! I'm @silent-this-sonder, and welcome to my profile 😄

I am a:
- girl
- coder
- artist
- writer
- 🎮amateur text adventurer
- 😆owner of outdated books

## Coding
I "know" a variety of languages, but my oldest is Python, which I am most comfortable with.

I love OOP, recursion, and anything cool.

My other languages are:
- Scratch, my other favorite place to hang out
- Inform 7, yes it's a rather unconventional language but it's got so many nuances and I like it (so don't question it😠)
- HTML
- CSS (please no😭)
- JavaScript (still learning, it's pretty cool)

## What I'm Working On
I have a lot of project ideas.  Right now, I'm working on an Inform 7 text adventure and a Scratch project.  However, I also have plans for a pygame thing.
