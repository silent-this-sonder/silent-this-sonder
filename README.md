# About Me
Hi! I'm @silent-this-sonder, and welcome to my profile ðŸ˜„

I am a:
- girl
- coder
- artist
- writer
- ðŸŽ®amateur text adventurer
- ðŸ˜†owner of outdated books

## Coding
I "know" a variety of languages, but my oldest is Python, which I am most comfortable with.

I love OOP, recursion, and anything cool.

My other languages are:
- Scratch, my other favorite place to hang out
- Inform 7, yes it's a rather unconventional language but it's got so many nuances and I like it (so don't question itðŸ˜ )
- HTML
- CSS (please noðŸ˜­)
- JavaScript (still learning, it's pretty cool)
